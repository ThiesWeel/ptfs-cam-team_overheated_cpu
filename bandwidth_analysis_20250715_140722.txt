Write Allocate Evasion Assessment
=================================

Write allocate evasion is a memory optimization technique where cache lines
are not allocated on write misses, allowing streaming writes to bypass the
cache hierarchy and achieve higher memory bandwidth.

Key Indicators of Effective Write Allocate Evasion:
1. High sustained memory bandwidth (>80 GB/s for this system)
2. Consistent bandwidth across different problem sizes
3. Performance that doesn't degrade with larger datasets
4. Cache hit rates remain reasonable despite large working sets

Overall Assessment:
==================

Recommendations:
===============
1. Check if memory bandwidth saturates the available hardware capacity
   - Expected peak: ~204 GB/s for DDR4-3200 dual-channel
   - Achieved peak: Use the maximum bandwidth from results above

2. Verify consistent performance across problem sizes
   - Consistent bandwidth suggests effective write allocate evasion
   - Large variations may indicate cache thrashing or NUMA issues

3. For optimal write allocate evasion:
   - Ensure compiler optimizations are enabled (-O3, -xHost)
   - Use streaming stores for large arrays
   - Consider non-temporal stores for write-once data
   - Verify NUMA binding is correct (cores 0-17 for domain 0)

4. Additional optimizations to consider:
   - Prefetching for regular memory access patterns
   - Loop tiling for better cache locality
   - SIMD optimizations (AVX-512 as already implemented)
   - Memory alignment for optimal access patterns
